# Assignment:  A Foundational React Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Brief Description

This project is a basic, single-page application (SPA) built with **React.js** and **React Router**. It serves as a foundational exercise in web development, demonstrating core concepts of a modern frontend framework. The website features a simple structure for "Melissa Event Services," including a Home page, an About Us page, and a Contact Us form. My primary goal was to create a functional and visually presentable site from scratch within a short timeframe, focusing on core React, HTML and CSS principles.

## Key Features & Technologies Used

This project was built to solidify my understanding of fundamental web technologies:

* **React.js:** Used as the primary JavaScript library for building the user interface.
* **React Router DOM:** Implemented for client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between `Home`, `About`, and `Contact Us` pages without full page reloads.
* **Modular Component Design:** Demonstrated by creating reusable components like the `Card` (used multiple times on the Home page to showcase services) and `AnimatedButton` (used on Home and Contact pages).
* **CSS3:** Utilized for all styling, focusing on:.
* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the web pages.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For component logic, event handling, and data imports.
* **Local Image Assets:** Images are imported and displayed from the local `src/images` directory, demonstrating asset handling in a React build environment.

## My Learning Journey

Building this project from scratch was an invaluable learning experience, especially given the time constraint. My key takeaways include:

* **Understanding HTML, CSS, JS and React from scratch**
* **Understanding React's Component-Based Architecture:** Solidifying how to break down a UI into smaller, reusable components.
* **Client-Side Routing with React Router:** Gaining practical experience in setting up navigation in an SPA, understanding `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route`.
* **CSS Integration in React:** Effectively managing styles across multiple components and applying global styles, including hover effects and typography rules.
